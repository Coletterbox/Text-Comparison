Impaired performance in cognitive tasks appears to be a transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology (C-factor)1, and factor models indicate a large degree of covariation among all forms of psychopathology in population samples (P-factor)2. However, the precise causal relationships between a putative C-factor and a P-factor are unclear. Further, while the fitting of such models may provide insight into transdiagnostic features of psychopathology and cognitive impairments, they do little to explain the specific psychological mechanisms or symptoms in question3,4. Therefore, our primary objective was to assess if attention dysregulation may be a critical component of transdiagnostic cognitive deficits and disparate psychopathological features. This would have important implications for future research examining cognitive deficits in psychopathology and potential clinical impact.
